🚀 About the Project: Customer Churn Analysis
This project analyzes customer churn data using SQL for data extraction and transformation, and Power BI for building interactive dashboards. The objective is to uncover insights into customer churn patterns, identify key factors contributing to churn, and provide actionable recommendations to improve customer retention strategies.

Key tasks involved:

Creating SQL views for data extraction and aggregation.
Cleaning and transforming data using SQL and Power BI.
Building interactive dashboards in Power BI to visualize churn trends and key metrics.
Generating actionable insights and recommendations based on demographic, geographic, and time-based trends.
🛠️ Tools Used
SQL: For data extraction, cleaning, and transformation.
Power BI: For creating interactive dashboards and data visualization.
Power Query: Used within Power BI for further data transformations and cleaning.
Excel: Used for initial exploration and basic data analysis.
📝 Procedure Followed
Step 1: Data Extraction and View Creation using SQL
View Tables Creation:
SQL views were created to streamline the process of extracting key metrics such as total churn, active customers, and churn rate by customer demographics (age, gender, tenure, etc.). These views aggregated data at the customer level and helped in simplifying the analysis.

Data Cleaning and Transformation:
The data was cleaned using SQL to handle missing values, standardize customer information (e.g., consistent naming and data types), and remove duplicates. This ensured that the dataset was accurate and ready for further analysis.

Columns were standardized (e.g., gender codes were standardized from "M/F" to "Male/Female").
Customers with incomplete or erroneous data were excluded from the analysis.
Step 2: Data Analysis using SQL Queries
Aggregating Customer Data:
SQL queries were used to compute key metrics like churn rates, retention rates, and the number of customers in each segment. Queries were built to group customers by demographic characteristics, such as age, gender, and tenure, to uncover churn trends across different customer profiles.

Churn Rate Calculation:
The churn rate was calculated by dividing the number of churned customers by the total number of customers in each segment. This helped identify which customer segments (age, gender, or tenure) had the highest churn rates.

Step 3: Data Transformation in Power BI using Power Query
Importing and Cleaning Data:
The cleaned data from SQL was imported into Power BI for further transformation. Power Query was used to adjust data types, handle any remaining missing values, and create new calculated columns like churn percentage and customer tenure.

Additional Transformations:
Further data transformation was performed within Power BI to create additional fields such as churn rates per demographic, age group analysis, and product preferences. These transformed datasets were prepared for visualization.

Step 4: Data Visualization and Dashboard Creation in Power BI
Creating Interactive Dashboards:
In Power BI, interactive dashboards were created to visualize churn trends across customer demographics. Visualizations included:

Bar Charts for churn rates by age group, gender, and tenure.
Pie Charts showing the distribution of churn across customer segments.
Line Graphs to track churn rates over time, identifying trends and seasonality.
Adding Interactivity:
Filters, slicers, and drill-down options were added to the dashboards, allowing users to interact with the data and analyze churn rates across various segments, time periods, and customer profiles. The dashboards provided a comprehensive view of churn patterns.

Step 5: Insights Generation and Recommendations
Demographic Insights:

Age Group Analysis: Insights were generated based on churn rates across different age groups. For example, the churn rate was highest in certain age groups, which could be targeted for retention efforts.
Gender-Based Insights: A higher churn rate was observed among female customers compared to male customers. Understanding the reasons behind this could guide targeted interventions.
Tenure-Based Insights: Customers with longer tenures exhibited a higher churn rate, suggesting a need for loyalty programs and proactive engagement with long-term customers.
Geographic and Time-Based Insights:

Although specific geographic data was not available in all cases, geographic trends were inferred, suggesting the need for regional strategies.
Time-Based Trends: Churn rates showed consistency across various time periods, but higher churn was noted during certain months, indicating seasonality effects.
Key Recommendations:

Demographic-Specific Strategies: Tailor retention efforts based on demographic factors (e.g., targeting older age groups or female customers).
Proactive Engagement for Long-Tenure Customers: Design programs to engage customers with longer tenures who might be at risk of leaving.
Geographic Customization: Based on geographic trends, create region-specific promotions or customer service strategies to reduce churn.
Time-Based Interventions: Use time-based insights to predict and manage churn during peak periods, such as holidays or product launch seasons.
🔑 Key Insights & Findings
Demographic-Based Insights:

Age Group: The 50-70 age group represents the largest customer segment, contributing to a significant portion of churn.
Gender: Churn is higher for female customers compared to male customers.
Tenure: Customers with a tenure of more than 24 months showed a high churn rate, indicating that even long-term customers are at risk.
Geographic-Based Insights:

While geographic data was not explicitly analyzed, it is likely that regional factors (e.g., competition, local support quality) play a role in churn trends.
Time-Based Insights:

Churn rates were consistent across different periods, but higher churn was noted in specific months, likely due to seasonal effects or product lifecycle.
